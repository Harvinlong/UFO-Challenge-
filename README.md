# Browsable User Web Pages for UFO Sighting Data 

Overview of Project: 
The purpose is to create a webpage using Javascript and HTML, to present the data of UFO sightings, and also create custom dropdown menus that allow users to filter for multiple criteria at the same time. In addition to the date, youâ€™ll add table filters for the city, state, country, and shape.

The project involves creating four new list elements: city, state, country, and shape, and updating the filters variable to keep track of all the elements that change when a search is entered. 

Logic Flow:
1: The updateFilters() function replaces the handleClick() function and updates the filter variable. 

2: The filterTable() function filters the table data by the value that is entered for the "id" that has changed. 

3: In the updateFilters() function, code is written to update the filters based on user input, and the filterTable() function is called to filter the table based on the user input stored in the filter variable. 

4: Finally, the filtered data is stored in a variable created before by looping through the filter object and storing the data that matches the filter values.
