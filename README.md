# UFO-Challenge-

Overview of Project: 
Our goal is to use the function of javascript to consolidate data and visualize it in HTML. Let the user can freely obtain the target data.

Results:
First get the data from the library of data, and then use JAVA filters to extract the data we need. We present the data chart in D3 of Javascript and create a window for user input.

Summary: 
Javascript's visualization capabilities are more complex than sql's, and there aren't many existing features you can use directly. Javascript requires more Code than you can normally do with a single line in Python.
